# HTML-CSS

I replicated the web with the followings improvements:

- Responsive Design
- Semantic Elements in HTML
- BEM Methodology CSS
- Use of Conventional Commits

I have taken the opportunity to include a personal project (Open Spaces) that meets the criteria of the last exercises offered in FreeCodeCamp.
